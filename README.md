# IngressKit
 Lightweight data ingress toolkit: CSV/Excel import repair SDK, Webhook Harmonizer, and JSON Normalizer with deterministic, tenant-aware memory.
IngressKit makes anything fit. Clean messy CSV/Excel into canonical schemas, normalize webhooks from popular providers into one predictable shape, and repair LLM/third‑party JSON to strict specs. Deterministic transforms, audit traces, and per‑tenant memory so it gets better over time.
