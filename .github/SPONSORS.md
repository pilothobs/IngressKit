# Sponsor IngressKit

## 🛠️ **What is IngressKit?**

IngressKit is a self-hosted data repair toolkit that solves the universal problem of messy data ingestion. Every developer has built CSV importers that break on weird headers, webhook parsers that fail when APIs change, and JSON validators for LLM outputs. IngressKit solves this once and for all.

**🎯 Key Features:**
- **CSV/Excel Repair**: Smart header mapping, type coercion, unit conversion
- **Webhook Harmonization**: Stripe/GitHub/Slack → unified format  
- **JSON Normalization**: Fix LLM outputs to strict schemas
- **Privacy-First**: Self-hosted, your data never leaves your servers
- **Deterministic**: Same input = same output, with complete audit trails

## ❤️ **Why Sponsor?**

IngressKit is **free and MIT-licensed** - it always will be. But maintaining a high-quality developer tool takes time and effort:

- 🔧 **Feature Development**: New schemas, webhook sources, performance improvements
- 🐛 **Bug Fixes**: Keeping the tool reliable for everyone
- 📚 **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples
- 🤝 **Community Support**: Helping users and reviewing contributions
